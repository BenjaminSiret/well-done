## About the project
Well Done helps you keep track of all your accomplishments, from the smallest to the biggest victory.<br/>
I created this app to practice, improve my skills, and also because I wanted a way to keep track of my achievements. I tend to overlook how far I've come, and this app helps me to recognize and celebrate my successes.
